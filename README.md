QUESTIONS:

1. Write a polyfill function for Array.filter

2. Flatten the given array without using any inbuilt functions -
[4, [2,3], [5, [5, 6, 2]], [9,8, [23, 5]]]

3. Sort the giver array of objects by distance from your given location using Mongodb aggregate
query -
Your location object is -
 {
 name: "Shashank Saxena",
 latitude: "28.535517",
 longitude: "77.391029",
 }
Array -
[
 {
 name: "Abhishek",
 latitude: "26.449923",
 longitude: "80.331871",
 },
 {
 name: "Akhtar",
 latitude: "27.167641",
 longitude: "27.167641",
 },
 {
 name: "Raj",
 latitude: "28.632429",
 longitude: "77.218788",
 },
 {
 name: "Ravi",
 latitude: "25.435801",
 longitude: "81.846313",
 },
]

4. Sort the above given array of objects by distance from your given location in core javascript.

5. The given is a file url -
https://file-examples.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/file_example_MP3_700KB.mp3
i) Create a read stream for the given file and when the data is available emit an mp3 event with
received data using the event emitter class.
ii) Attach an event handler on mp3 event and save the data in file system.

6. Write an HOC to check if user is authenticated using the redux/flux. If user is authenticated then
let the page load otherwise redirect to home/login page.
(Write only a single page for HOC, donâ€™t have to setup whole project. You can assume that there is
a isAuthenticated key in redux store to identify whether user is logged in or not)
